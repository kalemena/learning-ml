== Questions / Answers

.What are *fp16* vs *fp32* model differences ?
In short, fp16 reduces memory footprint and CPU consumption while having little downside on quality.
fp16 migh therefore be helpful to train faster, which little chances to overfit

.What is *safetensors* ?
See link:https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors[].
This basically addresses a few limitations and security aspects of *ckpt* (pickle)
